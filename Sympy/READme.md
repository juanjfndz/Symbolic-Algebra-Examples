# Sympy Examples

This repository contains examples of how to use the SymPy library, a Python library for symbolic mathematics.

## Contents

- `Fourier_Transform.ipynb`: Example of how to use SymPy to perform Fourier transforms and their inverses.
- `Laplace_transform.ipynb`: Example of how to use SymPy to perform Laplace transforms and their inverses.
- `Differential_Equation.ipynb`: Example of how to use SymPy to solve ordinary differential equations.
- `Lorentz_factor.ipynb`: Example of how to use SymPy to calculate the Lorentz factor for special relativity.
- `Schrödinger_Equation.ipynb`: Example of how to use SymPy to solve the Schrödinger equation for quantum mechanics.


## Installation

To use the examples in this repository, you need to have SymPy installed. You can install SymPy using pip:

```
pip install sympy
```

## Usage

The examples are organized into Jupyter notebooks, which can be run locally on your machine or on a cloud-based service like Google Colab.

To run the notebooks locally, first clone the repository to your machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sympy-examples.git
