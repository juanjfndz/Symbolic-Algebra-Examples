    "# Introduction to Special Relativity\n",
    "\n",
    "Special Relativity is a fundamental theory of physics that describes the behavior of objects in motion relative to each other. It was first introduced by Albert Einstein in 1905, and has since become a cornerstone of modern physics.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most striking consequences of Special Relativity is the concept of time dilation. This effect occurs when two observers, moving relative to each other, experience time passing at different rates. Specifically, an observer moving at a high velocity relative to a stationary observer will experience time passing more slowly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The magnitude of this effect is described by the Lorentz factor, which is given by the equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $v$ is the relative velocity between the two observers and $c$ is the speed of light.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Lorentz factor plays a key role in many aspects of Special Relativity, including time dilation, length contraction, and relativistic mass.\n",
    "\n",
    "This Python script demonstrates how to calculate the Lorentz factor and time dilation for a given velocity and time experienced by a stationary observer. By using these equations, we can gain a deeper understanding of the behavior of objects in motion relative to each other, and the fundamental principles of Special Relativity. "
